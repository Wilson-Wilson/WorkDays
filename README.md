# WorkDays
This app was made upon request by an interviewer over the course of four days. The purpose is to give a boss the ability to let workers know whether or not they should come to work based on the weather. The app makes an API call to get the weather forecast for that week, then sends an email to employees with work instructions based on said forecast.
